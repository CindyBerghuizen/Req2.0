\label{anchor}
A bad prototype session would be to bias participants to like the prototype. One way this can be achieved is the \emph{Anchoring as priming effect}. Before starting the prototype session the participants are shown fake results from a hypothetical prior prototype session. These results show that a separate group really like the prototype and on average gave very positive feedback on it. Although the new participants should not be affected by these results, the anchoring effect suggests that they are more likely to give more positive feedback as well. In the worst case the new participants will exactly match the fake results resulting in a completely useless prototype session.
