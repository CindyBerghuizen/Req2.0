\paragraph{Feature: Pop-up}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Desly

		\end{itemize}
	\item Jimmy
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Extra information helps learning.
			\item Can be a distraction.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Feature: Graph}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Desly
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Realtime feedback
			\item Easier to see relations between values and representation
			\item (Does this only work for linear graphs?)
			\item (Can you only change the graph and see the values change or also the values so the graph changes?)
		\end{itemize}
	\item Jimmy
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Interaction helps understanding.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Feature: Perspective}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Desly
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Definition view could provide more detail and image view more a global idea.
			\item Freedom to choose your reading style.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Jimmy
		\begin{itemize}
			\item (Can you swap at any time?)
			\item Different views creates a diverse and less boring experience.
			\item Natural in use; you use different representations for different things.
			\item Maybe not all information can be properly defined in both formats.
			\item Swapping between views could make reading hard/cluttered.
