\subsection{Depletion of System 2}
As stated before:\emph{ "If you have to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around" }.
This experiment will focus on this idea and attempt to influence the results.

\paragraph{Setup} For this experiment, 2 questionnaires will be created and 2 groups will answer one of them. One of the questionnaires will contain a large amount of boring and obvious questions before the questions we actually care about. The other questionnaire will contain only the questions we want answers on. The idea behind this is that the group that has to answer a great amount of boring questions will get annoyed and start to force themselves to go on and answer the questionnaire in such a way that they get it over with as soon as possible. In contrast, the other group will have just the core questions and therefore will not need to force themselves through a long and boring questionnaire.

\paragraph{Expected Outcomes}We expect the group that will have to force themselves to finish the questionnaire to do it in a manner to get it done as fast as possible. Therefore we expect that they will be more likely to answer with the first possible option. In contrast we expect the group that will not have to force themselves to finish the questionnaire  to think their answers more deeply and critically.
