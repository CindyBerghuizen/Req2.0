\subsubsection{Group Observations}

In the group prototype sessions we observed how group dynamics affected the direction of the discussion.Our first observation was that when a feature was presented and one of the participants had a strong negative opinion about it then the other participants that were unsure followed this opinion and it was impossible to change the group effect even if we started indicating some good points of this feature. \\

The next observation considers the speed with which the group arrives at a consensus depending on the starting idea. If this idea is perceived by the group as good, then everyone agreed and there was no further discussion, we had to doubt this idea to make the group start again the discussion.\\

The final observation regards how the group builds their perception of an idea on the first idea that comes up in the discussion. Even if the idea does not have a solid base, the other participants will add their ideas on the first one without refuting or doubting it. This is called group thinking~\cite{janis}.
