\subsection{Setup}

A bad prototype session would be to bias participants to like the prototype. One way this can be achieved is the \emph{Anchoring as priming effect}. Before starting the prototype session the participants are shown fake results from a hypothetical prior prototype session. These results show that a separate group really (dis)like the prototype and on average gave very positive(negative) feedback on it. Although the new participants should not be affected by these results, the anchoring effect suggests that they are more likely to give more positive(negative) feedback as well. In the worst case the new participants will exactly match the fake results resulting in a completely useless prototype session.\\

This is the experiment we conducted to test the anchoring theory. As described in sections~\ref{anchor} and above, the participants are required to fill out a questionnaire in which they rate the presented features on a scale 1 to 10. This survey starts with a few lead-in questions and then moves on to the features, after the features there is a open text question for feedback and comments and the final question asks the participants to give their overall rating for the eTextbook. The questions display the averages of a 'hypothetical' prior experiment.  \\

To measure the anchoring effect we created two questionnaires, both using the same questions. While the questions are the same, the averages for the questions are swapped; question `x' is rated high in one and low in the other. This setup can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:qComp}. After the experiment we measure the average and median of the answers for the high and the low one to see if the anchoring had any effect on our participants.

Our results show that the anchoring effect is obvious in many cases. Only one question has an inconclusive difference and the deviation cannot be contributed to the anchoring effect for sure.
