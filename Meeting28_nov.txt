conducting an experiment, that shows the effectiveness of different prototypes.
(we have beliefs, constraints, domain knowledge)

Building a prototype, you know which requirements get which form. You're validating or invalidating those requirements (i.e beliefs you have given form).


DIfference between generic goal of a prototype. Goal of this assignment is to conduct the prototype, to get better understanding of prototyping. Thus gain understanding on the subject (of prototyping) finding the pitfalls.

Questions
  With what goal do you make a prototype?
    * Get better understanding: Impression from 2D drawings is difficult. 3D scale representation its easier (for buying a house)
    * Trying to refute the prototype / find errors. Prototype is a chance to isolate errors, before starting

  Effectiveness of prototype
    * Flaws/errors you find, 
    * Estimation of errors in whole system is difficult
    * If you bring some seeded errors in your product, the amount of errors that are not found is indication of total errors not found.
      - Contradictory requirements
    
  What is a prototype?
    * E-book prototype could be power point presentation (or hardcover book) / sophisticated software. We don't have to build an elaborate prototype.
    * Not a whole system
    * Parts that are most prone to mistakes/errors

  How to prototype
    * Show prototype -> ask people reaction
    * Let people use prototype -> observe reactions
    * What you often see, teams have been making requirements. They are proud of the prototype, thus glamorous way of presenting. Whatever you like to see
      succesful product. It is a great pitfall, as you won't find flaws
      - Stakeholders are cognitive ease (looks good, go on)
      - Should bring people with domain knowlegde, critical view (not a stakeholder)
      (halo effect if UI is nice)
    
  Where does Kahneman fit in?
  
    - (andere groep) Priming: woorden in presentatie om reactie vragen achteraf te beinvloeden (heavy - hoeveel weegt deze ipad)
    - (andere groep2) Cognitive ease:
