Show all the things you already know are good.
Constantly harass into your own features
Provide distractions
Do not let system 2 work

Make a "draaiboek" for what to press and such (robot)
Manly only instructions
Don't pay attention to anything they say. (instructed robots)
Don't act upon their reactions.
Don't show anything outside the view of their own product.
Priming on good stuff

Give them some mind depleting exercises

Bad target group. (people who already like your product)

Projecting on what you know ( relate it on something they already love, iPhone6 answering the question if they
like the iPhone 5 / Apple)

priming, cognitive ease (situation they know)

Cognitive ease; making people comfortable by giving them food :)

Bad Session Theory:

- Bad Target Group -> Answering Easier Question (People who already like it)-> The Outside view, Chiel
- Cognitive ease -> Happy environment to prototyping (Ease,Mood and Intuition) Mary
- Deplete system 2, Cindy
- Anchoring to give yourself favorable results (LSN), Chiel
- Availability biasis. Mary
- Priming / Framing on the good features, CIndy

Good prototype session:
- Prototype session closely related to reality
- Intervene / let them experiment
- Priming creativity 
 
Answers You Will Get
