\section{Experiment}

We will try to change the mood of the session. Our idea is that a happy, positive group is less capable of critizing and more likely to rely on cognitive ease. 
They will approve or agree on features that would otherwise (in neutral or negative mood) considered less optimal. 

\paragraph{Experiment A}
We will do so by creating a highly enthousiast group by showing one group inspirational/achievement videos (``win compilations, satisfying gifs''). 

\paragraph{Experiment B}
One group will be put on their nerves by viewing ``less satisfying gifs''. These are gifs that typically end before showing the achievement, or have the achievement removed. The idea is that they are now more likely to look at errors and be skeptical to anything we could say. Thus, coming up with suggestions and additions we perhaps didn't think of and provide a useful prototyping session. 

\paragraph{Base group}
A last group shouldn't see any videos/gifs at all, to see if we actually varied our mood as intended.
