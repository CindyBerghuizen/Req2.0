\section{Experiment - Anchoring}

In this expirement for the prototype session we will try to affect the results of the session by anchoring the participants. As described in the theory section anchoring (/ref{anchor}) the participants are required to fill out a form which states how much they like each of the new features (on a scale 1 to 10) that were mentioned in the requirements documents along which some more general questions on reading. On these question sheets the averages of a 'hypothetical' prior expirement will be stated as well. \\

To measure the anchoring effect we will hand out two different questionaires. The questions will remain the same however the averages we put after the questions will differ. One questionaire contains a high anchor 'average' and the other one a low anchor 'average'. Then after the experiment we will measure the difference between the high and the low one to see if the anchoring had any effect on our participants.\\

If anchoring effect is real and other factors such as small experiment group don't affect the results to much than the difference between the high anchor average and the low anchor average should be positive and we should be able to observe this for a number of questions in our questionaire.
