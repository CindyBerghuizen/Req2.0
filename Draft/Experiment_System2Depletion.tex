As stated before:\emph{ "If you have to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around" }.
This experiment will focus on this idea and attempt to influence the results.

\paragraph{Set-up}
For this experiment, 2 questionnaires will be created and 2 goups will each answer one of those. One of the questionnaires contains a large amount of boring and obvious questions before the questions we actually care about. The other questionnaire contains only the questions we want answers on. The idea behind this is that the group that has to answer a great amount of boring questions get annoyed and start to force themselves to go on with the questionnaire in such a way that they get it over with as soon as possible. In contrast, the other group has just the core questions and has therefore no need to force themselves through a long and boring questionnaire.

\paragraph{Possible Outcomes} %Expected Outcomes?
We expect the group that had to force themselves to finish the questionnaire to do it in a manner to get it done as fast as possible. Therefore we expect that they are more likely to answer for the first possible option. In contrast we expect the group that did not have to force themselves to finish the questionnaire  tool think more deeply about the questions.
